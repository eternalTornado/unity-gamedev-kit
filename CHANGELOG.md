## [1.1.2] — 2026-04-15

### Fixed — Player Fantasy fully excised from runtime surface
- Agents were still proposing a `Player Fantasy` section during `/adopt` retrofits. Root cause: residual "player fantasy" phrasing in `creative-director` description, `design-docs` rule, and the `/adopt` note block nudged the model to re-introduce the 8th section. All runtime-facing mentions have been scrubbed.
- `creative-director` agent description: now owns "game pillars and tone" (no `player fantasy`).
- `rules/design-docs.md`: concept-doc hint rewritten without the word "fantasy".
- `/adopt`: legacy-section note replaced with a hard rule — never invent or re-add non-implementation-actionable sections; retrofit is strictly 7-section.
- `/brainstorm`, `/design-system`, `docs/TUTORIAL.md`, `docs/SKILLS.md`, `docs/AGENTS.md`: "fantasy" language replaced with "experience" / "creative framing" / "pillars" so nothing in the package re-suggests the removed section.

### Changed — `/adopt` gap report must use full section names
- The gap matrix table now **MUST** use full column headers (`Overview`, `Detailed Rules`, `Formulas`, `Edge Cases`, `Dependencies`, `Tuning Knobs`, `Acceptance Criteria`) — abbreviated codes like `1-Ov`, `4-Fo` are prohibited.

## [1.1.1] — 2026-04-15

### Changed — GDD format (7 sections, was 8)
- **Removed** `Player Fantasy` from mandatory GDD sections. The GDD is now the **feature spec** consumed by speckit in Phase 4, so sections must be implementation-actionable. Mood, tone, and player fantasy content belongs in `Design/GDD/game-concept.md`, not per-system GDDs.
- New mandatory 7 sections: Overview, Detailed Rules, Formulas, Edge Cases, Dependencies, Tuning Knobs, Acceptance Criteria (+ optional Game Feel).
- Updated files: `.claude/rules/design-docs.md` (source of truth), `.claude/commands/{adopt,design-system,design-review,review-all-gdds,diff-design,code-audit,update-gdd,quick-design,project-stage-detect,gate-check,implement,start}.md`, `.claude/hooks/validate-commit.sh`, `.github/workflows/unity-ci.yml`, template `CLAUDE.md`.
- `/adopt` now flags legacy `Player Fantasy` sections and offers to relocate their content into the concept doc.
- `creative-director` agent still owns player fantasy (now scoped to the concept doc).

### Migration notes
- Existing GDDs with a `Player Fantasy` section remain valid; run `/adopt` to relocate the content to `Design/GDD/game-concept.md` and drop the section.
- CI grep loop no longer warns on missing `Player Fantasy`.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-04-15

### Changed — Workflow restructure (BREAKING)
- **5-phase workflow** replaces 7-phase. New phases: Concept → Systems Design → Architecture → Implementation → Polish.
- `/gate-check` phases renamed: `tech` → `architecture`, `preprod` + `prod` merged into `implementation`, `polish` + `release` merged into `polish`.
- Phase 4 (Implementation) now delegates to [speckit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit) for `/plan` → `/tasks` → `/implement`. `/speckit.specify` is skipped because the GDD already contains the feature spec.
- Document locations for speckit outputs: `Docs/specs/<module>/plan.md`, `tasks.md` (override of speckit's default `specs/<feature>/`).

### Added — New command
- `/implement <module>` — Phase 4 entry point. Reads GDD + architecture doc, delegates to speckit (`/plan` → `/tasks` → `/implement`), finishes with `/code-review`.

### Changed — Commands
- `/dev-story` is deprecated. It redirects to `/implement`. Legacy `Production/stories/` workflow is no longer the canonical flow.
- All commands now MUST end with a **"Suggested next step"** block — a short list of 1-3 commands the user could run next.
- Commands that collect user input (`/start`, `/setup-engine`, `/brainstorm`, `/map-systems`, `/design-system`, `/create-architecture`) now use the `AskUserQuestion` tool with **batched** questions (up to 4 per call). Free-form chat questions are reserved for truly open-ended inputs only.

### Added — Constitution-like features folded into CLAUDE.md
- **Session Rules** section: precedence hierarchy (GDD > CLAUDE.md > technical-preferences > rules > drafts), document focus (max 3 per task), `/clear` and `/compact` triggers, incremental writing.
- **Governance** section: AI must not self-approve gates, gate fail → fix → re-submit (max 2 cycles), P0 hotfix exception, constitution-like-change approval flow, compliance citations.
- **Speckit integration** section: explains the Phase 4 flow and where speckit writes its documents.
